		<h1 class="bigtt">Privacy Policy</h1>
		<p class="art">Grubwithus Inc. ("GOAT") provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection,
			use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of www.airgoat.com ("Site") and our mobile applications
			(“Application”). This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through this Site and Application.
			This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy
			Policy on the Site and Application. You are advised to consult this policy regularly for any changes. Unless otherwise
			defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our GOAT Terms of Use,
			accessible at Terms.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p></p>
		<p class="art">As used in this policy, the terms "using" and "processing" information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting
			the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited
			to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within
			our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p></p>
		<h2 class="att">INFORMATION, COLLECTION AND USE</h2>
		<p></p>
		<p></p>
		<p class="art">Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Site, Application, Services, features and content,
			to administer your Account (together, the "Service") and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p></p>
		<h2 class="att">PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</h2>
		<p></p>
		<p></p>
		<p class="art">In the course of using the Service, we may ask you to provide us with, or grant us access to, or permission to obtain,
			certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you; personally identifiable information
			may include, but is not limited to, your name, email address, phone number and credit card number and other billing information
			("Personal Information").</p>
		<p></p>
		<p></p>
		<p class="art">We collect Personal Information in connection with your registration to join our Service. You can register to join via
			the Site or by logging into your account with certain third party social networking sites ("SNS") (including, but not
			limited, to Facebook and Twitter) via our Site. If you decide to register by logging into an SNS via our Site, we will
			obtain the Personal Information you have provided to the SNS (such as your "real" name, profile picture, email address
			and other information you make publicly available via the applicable SNS) from the account you have with such SNS and
			use that information to create your GOAT account ("Account") and you will become a Registered User ("Registered User");
			the information we obtain may depend on the privacy settings you have with the SNS. The Personal Information an SNS has
			about you is obtained by the SNS independent of our Service. Other services including the SNS follow different rules regarding
			the use or disclosure of the Personal Information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or
			statements of the other services you use.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p></p>
		<p class="art">We also collect other information that you provide as part of registration and your use of the Service (e.g., without limitation,
			zip code, geographical data, birth month and day, and individual preferences) ("Non-Identifying Information").</p>
		<p></p>
		<p></p>
		<p class="art">We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying Information) to provide the Service,
			complete your transactions, and administer your inquiries.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p></p>
		<p class="art">Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other
			identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified.
			But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only
			with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences). We may combine your Personal Information
			with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other GOAT Users (defined below) to
			attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Service and to analyze and understand
			how our Site, Application and Service are used.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p></p>
		<p class="art">We also use your Personal Information to contact you with GOAT newsletters, email updates, marketing or promotional materials
			and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such
			communications from us, please click 'Unsubscribe' at the bottom of your email (no login required), or update your Account's
			"Notifications" section by logging into your account and clicking on the 'Notifications' tab when you are on your user
			settings page.</p>
