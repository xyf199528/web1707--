		<h1 class="bigtt">FAQs</h1>
		<h2 class="att">What is GOAT?</h2>
		<p class="art">Founded in 2015 and based in Los Angeles, California, GOAT is the safest way to buy and sell sneakers through your mobile
			device. Whether you're looking to buy rare sneakers, discover new ones, or make money by listing sneakers you already
			own, GOAT is your destination. And with an authentication service, buyer protection guarantee and great customer service,
			it's the safest option in the industry.</p>
		<h2 class="att">How does it work?</h2>
		<p class="art">Sellers list their sneakers for sale on GOAT, while buyers peruse over 75,000 sneakers on the website, iPhone and Android
			apps. If you make a purchase, sellers are required to ship their sneakers to us for verification first and once they're
			authenticated, we'll ship them to you. If we find they are replicas or they are not as described, we'll notify you and
			offer a full refund.</p>
		<h2 class="att">How do I delete my account?</h2>
		<p class="art">Simply contact help@goat.com and we'll handle this for you.</p>
		<h2 class="att">How do I contact you?</h2>
		<p class="art">We're always here to help. You can contact us by email 24/7 at help@goat.com.</p>
		<h1 class="bigtt">Orders, Shipping & Returns</h1>
		<h2 class="att">How do I place an order?</h2>
		<p class="art">Browse sneakers for sale, select your size and tap “Buy.” After you tap buy, enter your contact information, select a payment
			option and your sneakers will be on their way to you.</p>
		<h2 class="att">What payment options do you accept?</h2>
		<p class="art">We currently accept all major cards (credit, debit, prepaid and gift cards) that display a Visa, Mastercard, AMEX, Discover
			or JCB logo. All credit transactions are handled by Stripe and Braintree, the most secure payment processing companies.
			We also accept PayPal and provide financing through Affirm for U.S.-based iOS and Web users.</p>
		<h2 class="att">What is Affirm and how do I use it?</h2>
		<p class="art">We've partnered with Affirm to offer financing for U.S.-based iOS and web users, so you can get the sneakers you want now
			and pay later. Simply select Affirm Payment Plan on Checkout, provide basic information and get approved instantly. Pay
			over 3, 6, or 12 months with rates between 10-30% APR. To learn more about Affirm, visit: https://affirm.com/buy-with-affirm
			or email help@affirm.com.</p>
		<h2 class="att">I'm having issues purchasing. What do I do?</h2>
		<p class="art">Occasionally our payments processor is unable to complete your purchase. This can be for a number of reasons, including
			an incorrect credit card number, insufficient funds or wrong zip code. Please review the card number you entered and the
			zip code first and if those are correct, we recommend contacting the card issuing bank. If you’re still having issues,
			please email us at help@goat.com for additional assistance.</p>
		<h2 class="att">Can I cancel my order?</h2>
		<p class="art">You may cancel your order within 3 hours of placing it or before it is confirmed by the seller - whichever comes first.
			If 3 hours have passed from when you placed the order and/or the seller has confirmed the order, then the order cannot
			be canceled. If neither have occurred, simply tap the Cancel button on the Orders screen.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p></p>
		<p class="art">Please note: There are no cancellations on offers because it is confirmed by the seller when they accept your offer.</p>
